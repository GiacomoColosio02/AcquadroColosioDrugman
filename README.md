This repository contains the project developed for the **Software Engineering 2** course (A.Y. 2024-2025). The Group Members are: 
- **ACQUADRO PATRIZIO**
- **COLOSIO GIACOMO**
- **TITO NICOLA DRUGMAN**


The project is divided into two main deliverables:
1. **Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**
2. **Design Document (DD)**

# PROJECT PART 1: RASD
## Repository Structure
### A] RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
This explanation is dedicated to the development of the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**. For our project we have adopted the **Requirements Engineering (RE) Workflow** as the guiding methodology, dividing the work into the following structured steps:

To ensure a logical and organized approach to the Requirements Engineering (RE) workflow, the repository is divided into dedicated folders corresponding to each step of the process:

## **1. DeliveryFolder/**

This folder contains all necessary files and subfolders for the project delivery. Below is the folder structure with a brief description of each component:

### **ALLOY/**
This folder contains resources and files related to ALLOY modeling and analysis. It is used to develop and test formal specifications for the system.

### **Images/**
This folder stores all image wich are unreadable in the RASD Document, such as USE CASE DIAGRAMS.

### **UML_Codes/**
This folder includes UML code files present in the RASD

## **2. Elicit_Requirements/**

This folder contains all materials related to stakeholder analysis, domain analysis, and the study of existing systems. It is organized into the following subfolders and documents:

### **Folder 1: Problem and Domain Analysis**
- Notes taken from documentation
- Draft version 1: Potential solution schematization
- Draft version 2: Potential solution schematization
- Candidate Requirements Document
- Google Drive folder with all the work

### **Folder 2: Research_About_Documents (Analysis of Stakeholders)**
- Study 1: National survey of college internships (NSCI) 2021 report
- Study 2: Tougher than ever to secure a place on sought-after internships, 2024

### **Folder 3: Research_About_Existing_Software (Analysis of Existing Technologies and Potential Competitors)**
- **Subfolder 1:** LinkedIn
- **Subfolder 2:** Datapizza
- **Subfolder 3:** Other analyses

## **3. RASD_DOCUMENTS/**

This folder includes all materials related to the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD), structured into two subfolders:

### **Folder 1: RASD_Drafts**
- Combines the modeling and validation processes, holding structured models of requirements and documentation of the validation process. This includes:
  - All versions of the RASD
  - A text document explaining each RASD version

### **Folder 2: RASD_Final_Version**
- Contains the final version of the RASD, along with any supplementary materials. The finalized document is structured to clearly outline:
  - Final PDF version of the RASD document

---

## **4. Team_Progress_Tracking/**

This folder is designed to track progress in a structured and iterative way. It contains:
- A **link to the Google document** with the daily to-do list for the project, including detailed logs of tasks completed each day.
- A **link to the Google document** recording the time spent on each task, ensuring transparency and accountability.

---

## **5. Theoretical Documentation/**

This folder is used to contain all theoretical knowledge related to the project. Specifically, it includes:
- A course textbook built lesson by lesson
- An IEEE document containing the structure of the RASD
- A custom document created by the team on how to construct a RASD

### B] DD (Design Document)
To Be Defined
