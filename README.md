# Students&Companies Platform 
This repository contains the project developed for the **Software Engineering 2** course (A.Y. 2024-2025). The Group Members are: 
- **ACQUADRO PATRIZIO**
- **COLOSIO GIACOMO**
- **TITO NICOLA DRUGMAN TARANTOLA**


The project is divided into two main deliverables:
1. **Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**
2. **Design Document (DD)**

## Repository Structure
### A] RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
This explanation is dedicated to the development of the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**. For our project we have adopted the **Requirements Engineering (RE) Workflow** as the guiding methodology, dividing the work into the following structured steps:

To ensure a logical and organized approach to the RE Workflow, we have divided the repository into separate folders for each step of the process:

#### **1. Elicit_Requirements/**
Contains all materials related to stakeholder, domain analysis, and the study of existing systems. It includes:
- ...

#### **2.  RASD_DOCUMENTS/RASD_Drafts**
Combines the modeling and validation processes, holding structured models of requirements and documentation of the validation process. This includes:
- Natural language descriptions and formal requirement models
- Supporting diagrams and visualizations
- Records of inconsistencies and how they were resolved
- Finalized validated models

#### **3. RASD_DOCUMENTS/RASD_Final_Version**
Contains the final version of the RASD, along with any supplementary materials. The finalized document is structured to clearly outline:
- Requirements
- Domain assumptions
- System constraints
---
Than in order to track progress in a structured and iterative way, we have included the following folder: 
### **4. Team_Progress_Tracking**
It contains:
- A **link to the Google document** with the daily to-do list for the project, which also includes detailed logs of tasks completed each day.
- A **link to the Google document** with a records of time spent on each task, ensuring transparency and accountability.
