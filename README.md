# PROJECT PART 1: RASD
## Repository Structure
### A] RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
This explanation is dedicated to the development of the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**. For our project we have adopted the **Requirements Engineering (RE) Workflow** as the guiding methodology, dividing the work into the following structured steps:

To ensure a logical and organized approach to the Requirements Engineering (RE) workflow, the repository is divided into dedicated folders corresponding to each step of the process:


## **1. Elicit_Requirements/**

This folder contains all materials related to stakeholder analysis, domain analysis, and the study of existing systems. It is organized into the following subfolders and documents:

- **Folder 1: Problem and Domain Analysis**
  - Notes taken from documentation
  - Draft version 1: Potential solution schematization
  - Draft version 2: Potential solution schematization
  - Candidate Requirements Document
  - ...



- **Folder 2: Analysis of Stakeholders**
  - Study 1: National survey of college internships (nsci) 2021 report
  - Study 2: Tougher than ever to secure place on sought after internships, 2024
  - ...

- **Folder 3: Analysis of Existing Technologies and Potential Competitors**
  - **Subfolder 1:** LinkedIn
  - **Subfolder 2:** Datapizza
  - **Subfolder 3:** Other analyses



## **2. RASD_DOCUMENTS/**

This folder includes all materials related to the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD), structured into two subfolders:

- **Folder 1: RASD_Drafts**
  - Combines the modeling and validation processes, holding structured models of requirements and documentation of the validation process. This includes:
    - All versions of the RASD
    - A text document explaining each RASD version

- **Folder 2: RASD_Final_Version**
  - Contains the final version of the RASD, along with any supplementary materials. The finalized document is structured to clearly outline:
    - Final PDF version of the RASD document



## **3. Team_Progress_Tracking/**

This folder is designed to track progress in a structured and iterative way. It contains:

- A **link to the Google document** with the daily to-do list for the project, including detailed logs of tasks completed each day.
- A **link to the Google document** recording the time spent on each task, ensuring transparency and accountability.
