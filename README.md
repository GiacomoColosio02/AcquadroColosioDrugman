## Project Part 1: RASD

### Repository Structure

#### A] RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
This section is dedicated to the development of the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**. We have adopted the **Requirements Engineering (RE) Workflow** as the guiding methodology, which is divided into the following structured steps:
