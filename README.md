# Students&Companies Platform [Patrizio Acquadro, Giacomo Colosio, Tito Nicola Drugman Tarantola]

## Overview

This repository contains the project developed for the **Software Engineering 2** course (A.Y. 2024-2025). The goal of this project is to design and implement a **Students&Companies (S&C)** platform that matches university students seeking internships with companies offering opportunities. The platform supports several features including proactive internship search, recommendation systems, and management of the selection and internship processes.

The project is divided into two main deliverables:
1. **Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**
2. **Design Document (DD)**

## Project Part 1 : RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)

#### 1.1 What is the RASD DOCUMENT: A Brief Overview
**What is the Purpose of the RASD?**

The Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) serves as a critical resource for managing and communicating the system's requirements. Its main purposes include:

1. **Facilitating Communication**  
   The RASD bridges technical and non-technical stakeholders by clearly describing the system's domain and functionalities. It must be accessible to clients and users while providing technical details essential for developers.

2. **Contractual Role**  
   Often acting as a formal agreement, the RASD outlines the scope, functionality, and deliverables. It helps avoid disputes by ensuring accuracy and completeness.

3. **Foundation for Project Activities**  
   The RASD guides:
   - **Project Planning:** Prioritizing use cases, estimating resources, and scheduling.
   - **Verification and Validation (V&V):** Acting as the benchmark to ensure the system meets specifications and stakeholder needs.
   - **Change Control:** Managing evolving requirements and aligning system updates with the original design.

A well-crafted RASD is clear, precise, and structured to cater to both technical and non-technical readers.

**Who is the Audience of the RASD?**

The RASD addresses the needs of diverse stakeholders, including:

1. **Customers and Users**  
   Non-technical stakeholders who need an overview of how the system meets their requirements.

2. **Requirement and System Analysts**  
   Professionals who define and refine the system's requirements, often referencing multiple RASDs for related projects.

3. **Developers**  
   The RASD provides clear, unambiguous technical specifications for implementation.

4. **Quality Assurance (QA) Team**  
   QA uses the RASD to create test plans and ensure the system meets outlined requirements.

5. **Project Managers**  
   The document aids in planning, scheduling, and tracking project milestones.

6. **External Stakeholders**  
   Third parties or teams working on related projects rely on the RASD for context and integration needs.

**How Should We Write the RASD?**

The RASD must be:

1. **Comprehensive and Accessible**  
   - Include high-level overviews for non-technical audiences.  
   - Provide detailed specifications for developers and analysts.

2. **Well-Structured and Maintainable**  
   - Organized for easy updates as requirements evolve.  
   - Modular to accommodate new stakeholders or changes without confusion.

3. **Contextualized**  
   - Explain the rationale behind requirements to guide future integrations and modifications.

By ensuring clarity and adaptability, the RASD serves as a reliable reference for all stages of the project and all involved stakeholders.

## Submission Process
1. **Intermediate versions** of the documents should be committed and pushed regularly to this repository.
   a. Each group member must commit their contributions to this repository regularly.
   b. Collaborative writing tools (e.g., Google Docs) can be used, but ensure to provide a link in this README file that allows the reference professor to review individual contributions
2. All **final versions** should be placed in the `DeliveryFolder/` directory before the respective deadlines.
