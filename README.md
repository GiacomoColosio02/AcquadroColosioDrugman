# PROJECT PART 1: RASD
## Repository Structure
### A] RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
This explanation is dedicated to the development of the **Requirements Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**. For our project we have adopted the **Requirements Engineering (RE) Workflow** as the guiding methodology, dividing the work into the following structured steps:

To ensure a logical and organized approach to the Requirements Engineering (RE) workflow, the repository is divided into dedicated folders corresponding to each step of the process:

## **1. DeliveryFolder/**

This folder contains all necessary files and subfolders for the project delivery. Below is the folder structure with a brief description of each component:

### **ALLOY/**
This folder contains resources and files related to ALLOY modeling and analysis. It is used to develop and test formal specifications for the system.

### **Images/**
This folder stores all image assets used in the project, such as visual diagrams, illustrations, or screenshots. It serves as a central repository for graphical content.

### **UML_Codes/**
This folder includes UML code files that define and describe the system architecture, workflows, and interactions. It is structured to facilitate understanding of the projectâ€™s design through visual representations.

Each subfolder is organized to ensure easy navigation and efficient access to project resources.
