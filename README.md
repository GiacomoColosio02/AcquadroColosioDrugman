# Students&Companies Platform [Patrizio Acquadro, Giacomo Colosio, Tito Nicola Drugman Tarantola]

## Overview

This repository contains the project developed for the **Software Engineering 2** course (A.Y. 2024-2025). The goal of this project is to design and implement a **Students&Companies (S&C)** platform that matches university students seeking internships with companies offering opportunities. The platform supports several features including proactive internship search, recommendation systems, and management of the selection and internship processes.

The project is divided into two main deliverables:
1. **Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD)**
2. **Design Document (DD)**

## Project Schedule
- **RASD submission deadline**: 22/12/2024
- **DD submission deadline**: 07/01/2025
- **Final presentation**: TBA

## Repository Structure

## Documents

### 1. RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
The RASD defines the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, including:
- Scenarios, use cases, and domain models.
- UML diagrams, sequence diagrams, and Alloy models (if applicable).
- External interface requirements and functional details.
  
### 2. DD (Design Document)
The DD focuses on the systemâ€™s architectural and component design, including:
- High-level architecture and component interaction.
- UML diagrams for the runtime view, component interfaces, and design decisions.
- A detailed plan for implementation, integration, and testing of the system.

## Submission Process
1. **Intermediate versions** of the documents should be committed and pushed regularly to this repository.
2. All **final versions** should be placed in the `DeliveryFolder/` directory before the respective deadlines.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Each group member must commit their contributions to this repository regularly.
- Collaborative writing tools (e.g., Google Docs) can be used, but ensure to provide a link in this README file that allows the reference professor to review individual contributions.
  
## Hours Tracking
We keep track of the number of hours each group member works towards the fulfillment of each deadline. This information will be included in the respective RASD and DD documents under the "Effort Spent" section.
