How to Run the UML Code

1. Use a UML Coding Platform: To generate the UML diagrams, utilize a platform or tool that supports UML syntax. Recommended options include:
   - PlantUML
   - Lucidchart
   - Visual Paradigm
   - PlantUML Online Editor
   - IDE Plugins (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode)

2. Run the Code: Write and execute the UML code using the selected platform. Ensure the syntax matches the UML tool's requirements.

3. Export to SVG Format: After execution, export the generated diagram to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. SVG provides a high-quality, scalable visualization of the diagram.

4. Visualize the Diagram: Open the SVG file in your preferred viewer (e.g., a web browser or an image viewer) to analyze the visual representation of the UML code.

By following these steps, you can effectively generate and visualize the UML diagrams from the provided code.
